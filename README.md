# EaaFuzz: A Neural Network-Based Fuzzing Framework with Sparse Encoding and Energy-Aware Adaptive Mutation
Eaafuzz is a kind of fuzzy testing of coverage rate. Through the energy-aware adaptive fuzzy testing method of sparse self-encoder, it is specially modeled for the “input key section” and optimizes the variation strategy to make the fuzzy testing more accurate and efficient.
